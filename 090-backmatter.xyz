The typesetting software used the XeTeX engine and the text is set in the open source IBM Plex font family -- in Serif, Sans Serif and Monospace variants.


## Credits 



This project is constituted by files written in Markdown syntax and exported either as a standalone website both as printer-ready product. This is due to the awesome work of the people behind different libraries:

* [Pandoc](https://bookdown.org)
* [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org) 
* [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org) and [R](https://bookdown.org) environment.

As well, for the computational infrastructure, some tools have been used:

* [NLTK](https://bookdown.org)
* UDPIPE
* SciPY
